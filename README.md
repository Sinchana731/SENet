📌 Project Title
SENet-Based Image Classification

📖 Description
This project implements a deep learning-based image classification model using Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet). SENet enhances the representational power of a network by enabling it to perform dynamic channel-wise feature recalibration. The notebook trains a modified CNN model with SE blocks to improve classification accuracy on the chosen dataset.
